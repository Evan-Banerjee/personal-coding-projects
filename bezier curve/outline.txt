node class
    initialize 
        x position
        y position
        is a base node
        parent nodes
        children nodes
    update position
        move halfway between parent nodes

create drawing base nodes loop
    while drawing base nodes
        if mouse pressed
            create node where mouse is
        end loop if player presses space

function create curve
    create edit curve array loop
        recursively loop through the nodes so that the draw node moves in the right way
        place a marker (tuple) in the curve array where the draw node is

function draw curve
    uses the saved locations in the curve array to draw the curve


create drawing curve loop
    set curve array to 0

    call create curve function
    
    while player clicks on node
        set node to moving state
        move node coordinates to mouse position
        call create curve function
    
    call draw curve function
